# ICMP DoS Incident Response Report

This project documents the analysis and response to a simulated Denial of Service (DoS) attack
completed as part of the **Google Cybersecurity Analyst Certificate** program.

The scenario involved an ICMP packet flooding attack that disrupted internal network services
due to a misconfigured firewall. The project focuses on incident analysis, response actions,
and security improvements — not on performing attacks.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Incident response analysis (NIST framework)
- DoS / ICMP flood identification
- Firewall configuration and rate limiting
- IDS/IPS concepts
- Network monitoring and detection

## Tools & Concepts
- ICMP, DoS attacks
- Firewalls
- IDS/IPS
- Network traffic analysis
- Security incident documentation

## Disclaimer
This project is based on a **training scenario** from the Google Cybersecurity Analyst
Certificate and is intended for **educational and portfolio purposes only**.
